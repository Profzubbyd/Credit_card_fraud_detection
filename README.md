# Credit_card_fraud_detection
Credit card fraud is a huge problem not only for everyoneâ€™s personal life but also for financial institutions, cyber security, and the government. We are interested in this topic because financial institutions and even government pay more attention to fraud activities in these years. More people prefer to use more convenient payment methods such as credit card, online banking, and mobile payment instead of cash. Along with increasing transactions, the chances of fraud are much higher than before. Credit card fraud is the major concern for financial scams. 
We are trying to investigate the credit card fraud transaction. We would like to use data science knowledge to build the model and detect credit card fraud more easily and efficiently. We used different ways to investigate and propose two predictive models.
